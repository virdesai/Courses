How to run the code:

- From the UNC CS Shell Server type in "cd /afs/cs.unc.edu/project/courses/comp560-f15/users/vird/HW4" (no quotes)
- (Just in case) type chmod +x HW4.py
- (Just in case) type chmod +x svm.py
- (Just in case) type chmod +x svmutil.py
- To execute python script of file type: "python HW4.py" (no quotes)
- My code seems to have issues running on the server because of the svm.py class which was provided to me and not created on my own. The report shows what actually occurs when running the code. If needing to test, bring HW4.py, svm.py, svmutil.py, libsvm.dll, and the images folder if you do not have them to a Windows computer. With python installed you can then just run HW4.py and it will execute properly.
